Some miscellaneous code notebooks that I've put together.

A few exercises from Wasserman's All of Statistics. I like this book for reference. It has a good level of detail but is not overly verbose.

- A couple of computational exercises from All of Statistics, [Chapter 1](/_code/all_of_stats_ch1.ipynb)
