I found that the exercises in the [_Tiny Python Projects_](https://tinypythonprojects.com) repo were really interesting to learn a little about python scripting via the command line.

I forked [the repository](https://github.com/finlaymcalpine/tiny_python_projects/tree/master) (this is my own version of the repo) and completed most of the projects. They generally entail setting up a CLI using `argparse`, reading a text file or specified command line argument, and then undertaking a small task using the input. Mostly there's a lot of string parsing and manipulation, along with the use of standard python data structures.

The whole project is nicely set up for testing and building and I learned a lot while debugging some of these projects. The test will fail a fair bit, especially because some of the provided edge cases are pretty frustrating.

Having a small set of projects I can refer to in the future seems like a useful resource, and I'd recommend the repo to anyone looking to get some scripting practice.
