title: "Commitment in Monetary Unions"
---

In a time where I was more engaged in economic theory, I wrote a paper on the effect of a fiscal transfer mechanism on the credibility of monetary policy commitment for a currency union central bank. Some day I might revise and expand this paper, if I find a chance to get back into the literature. The topic was particularly interesting at the time (2018), as it lay in the aftermath of the Eurozone debt crisis. I am not sure whether or not that area of research gained much traction in the aftermath.
