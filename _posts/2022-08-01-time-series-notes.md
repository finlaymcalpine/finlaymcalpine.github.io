I'm scraping together some notes on the topic of time series analysis into Jupyter notebooks contained in [this repo](https://github.com/finlaymcalpine/ts-essentials), with the goal of having something that can act as a high-level reference for both myself and others. I don't plan to make it highly technical - although time series almost by necessity is a technical subject - but I do plan to include references to more advanced material for the interested reader.

In addition, I will use python to apply some of the topics covered - the applications will mostly cover financial or economic data.

Since I am pulling from a patchwork collection of notes it will take some time to get these up. Chapter specific notebooks are as follows:

- 0.1: [A Primer on Time Series](https://github.com/finlaymcalpine/ts-essentials/blob/main/Chapter%200.1.ipynb) - Introduction
- 0.2: [Time Series Properties](https://github.com/finlaymcalpine/ts-essentials/blob/main/Chapter%200.1.ipynb) - Stationarity and Unit Roots
