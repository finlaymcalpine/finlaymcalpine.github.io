While the linear regression model is widely used, it's not always intuitive or well understood. This post aims to briefly cover the linear model, the assumptions involved, and those assumptions allow us to do with the results of our regression.

### The Model

If we have a response (or dependent) variable _Y_ and one covariate (or feature) _X_, we can model the relationship between these in the following way:

_y~i~ = b~0~ \+ b~1~x~i~ \+ e~i~_
