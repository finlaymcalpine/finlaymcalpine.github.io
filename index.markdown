Economist, data person, occasional runner & climber.

This is a home for some thoughts I've put down on paper or on a screen. It's not a blog, but I am trying to get some past content up here.

Not everything here will be data-oriented. I may, from time to time, add some thoughts on non-professional topics of interest to me.

It will forever remain a work-in-progress.
