# About Me

I'm a general data person, with a mixed background of building forecasting models and data pipelines focused on economic and financial data.

Most recently I worked for an alternative data form in NYC, where I wore a number of analysis-hats: creating analytics pipelines to track KPIs, building webscrapers to grab data from new sources, and implementing new tooling to share data feeds with clients.

I'm looking for a new role that takes me away from dealing with reports and deliverables and with the chance to do more stats driven work (something I miss compared to a couple years ago).
