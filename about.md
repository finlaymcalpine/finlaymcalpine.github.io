I'm an economist and data professional, with a mixed background of building forecasting models and data pipelines focused on economic and financial data.

Most recently I worked for an alternative data firm in NYC, where I wore several data-oriented hats: creating analytics pipelines to track KPIs, building web scrapers to extract data from new sources, and implementing new tooling to share data feeds with clients.

Prior to that, I have mostly worked on economic and financial data: building forecasting models and interpreting economic data.

I have a broad set of experience working with stakeholders ranging from government policymakers to investment firms. With that comes a strong understanding of the importance of clear communication with end users and clients.

I'm looking for a new role with the chance to do work that uses statistical modelling to inform decision-making, and has a real impact on the direction of a team & firm.
